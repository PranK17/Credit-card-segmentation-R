# Credit-card-segmentation-R
Credit card segmentation in R 
This  case  requires  trainees  to  develop  a  customer  segmentation  to  define marketing strategy. The sample dataset summarizes the usage behaviour of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioural variables.

## Expectation
1. Advanced data preparation. Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving ‘intelligent’ KPI’s such as monthly average purchase
and cash advance amount, purchases by type (one-off, instalments), average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction,
limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio), payments to minimum payments ratio etc. 
2. Advanced reporting. Use the derived KPI’s to gain insight on the customer profiles.
3. Clustering. Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique 
and a clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioural segments of credit card holders.
